# üîç Splunk Enterprise Log Collection Lab

This lab demonstrates the full setup and configuration of **Splunk Enterprise** to collect and analyze Windows event logs in a simulated domain environment. The goal was to create a centralized log monitoring solution for multiple domain devices using a Universal Forwarder and Splunk's web interface.

## üß† Lab Objectives

- Install and configure **Splunk Enterprise**
- Enable TCP data input on port `9997`
- Configure **Windows Firewall** to allow Splunk traffic
- Install and configure **Splunk Universal Forwarder** on a domain member server
- Forward logs from ACIDM01 to ACIWIN11
- Collect and search Windows **Application**, **Security**, and **System** event logs

## üõ†Ô∏è Key Configurations

### üîπ Splunk Enterprise Configuration (ACIWIN11)

- Enabled TCP data input on port `9997`
- Firewall rule created to allow inbound traffic on ports `8089`, `9997`
- Created a new Server Class for ACIDM01
- Selected and indexed Application, Security, and System logs

### üîπ Splunk Forwarder Setup (ACIDM01)

- Installed Splunk Universal Forwarder with domain credentials
- Forwarded logs to `192.168.0.3` on ports `8089` and `9997`
- Selected Windows Event Log sources
